# Deck of Cards

By [Mary Dickson](http://www.marydickson.com).

## Description
**Deck of Cards** Exploring OOP with Ruby. This program will create an instance of a 52 card deck. It was written using BDD testing (red, green, refactor) to ensure that a deck can be created and shuffled.

Approach:
* Cards hold a rank and a suit
* Deck initializes as standard 52 card deck, or can be customized by replacing the ranks and suits. Initializing a deck creates the 52 cards in order, calling .shuffle! shuffles them.

## Usage

`rake test` to run tests
